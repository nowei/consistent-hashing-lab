## Part 1: Simple Load Balancer
* What does the distribution look like? 


* What might be a problem with this type of load balancing scheme?


## Part 2: The Key is Hashing
* What happened to the keys when you add or remove shards? 


* What might be a problem with this load balancing scheme?


## Part 3: Lost in Key-Space
* What might be a problem with this load balancing scheme? 


## Part 4: Consistent Hashing
* If the number of times we hashed to create slices goes towards infinity, what would we expect to see in the distribution of keys among servers? 


* What are some potential problems with this load balancing scheme?


Reflection
* What are some benefits/drawbacks when increasing the number of times that you hash the server name?


* How might you balance the workload on a distribution in which some keys were a lot more popular than other keys?


* How might you balance the workload if it was changing over time question? That is, some keys are popular at some times and others at other times.
